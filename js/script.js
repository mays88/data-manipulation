// QUOTE OF THE DAY

    "Progress means getting nearer to the place you want to be.\nAnd if you have taken a wrong turn, then to go forward does not get you any nearer.\nIf you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road;\nand in that case, the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man. \n -C.S Lewis";
